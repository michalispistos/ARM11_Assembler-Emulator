HOW WE'RE GONNA DO ASSEMBLER


2 PASS METHOD 
1) MAKE A LIST/FUNCTION THAT MAPS STRINGS TO INTEGER ADDRESSES.
    EACH INSTRUCTION GETS THEIR OWN ADDRESSES
2) GO THROUGH THE ENTIRE CODE AND FIND LINES OF THE FORM <BLAH>:
    THIS MEANS IT IS A BRANCH. WE THEN PUT 'BLAH' INTO OUR LIST AND
    ASSIGN IT THE ADDRESS.
        PERHAPS DELETE THESE LINES?
3) GO THROUGH THE CODE AGAIN AND THEN
