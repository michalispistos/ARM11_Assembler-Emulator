32 Bit Words = 4 Bytes
16 bits for memory location - each cell can hold 1 byte
    This gives a total of 64KB of memory
All instructions are 32 bits long - all instruction addresses are multiples of 4
    4 cells for 1 instruction

Memory locations and registers are set to NULL/0 when first switched on
We have 17, 32 bit registers.
    Registers 0 - 12 are general purpose
    Registers 13, 14 are ignored
    Register 15 is Program Counter
    Register 16 is CPSR
Instructions can change values in registers and memory
NOTE: 32 bits = 4 bytes = 8 hex

An all 0 instruction should tell the emulator to terminate
Values of register and non-zero memory locations should be displayed

CPSR's top 4 bits carry status flags from ALU.
    N Z C R
        N: Negative
        Z: Zero
        C: Bit carried out
        V: Overflow

Three stage pipeline:
    1) Fetch 4 byte instruction from memory
    2) Decode instruction
    3) Execute instruction
