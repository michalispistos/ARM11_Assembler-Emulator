Use git clone https://gitlab.doc.ic.ac.uk/lab1920_summer/arm11_42 to get from repo.
Use git pull to get the latest version.

Once it's on your machine, use git branch (SOMETHING) to make your own branch. Replace something with your name or something helpful.
Then use git checkout (SOMETHING) to move to that new branch.
Do your thing but make sure it won't cause conflict.
If person A works on file1.txt and person B works on file1.txt it causes a conflict.

Once you are done, use git add *. Then git commit -m "HELPFUL MESSAGE".
Then switch to master branch (git checkout master) and use git merge (NAME OF PREVIOUS BRANCH) to merge everything.

You can also create sub-branches etc. Remember to tell the group which part you're doing to avoid conflicts.
